Refactoring Golf
================

This repository provides a number of refactoring golf challenges as a
series of "holes". Each hole is usually more challenging than its
predecessors, although to some extent this depends on your choice of
refactoring tool.

The Java and C# holes are roughly equivalent in intent.

Rules
-----

* Where tests are provided, run these after every move
* Score +1 for any Resharper or Visual Studio refactoring, regardless of the number of keystrokes involved
* Score +1 for every other keystroke or multi-key combination [eg. Ctrl-C (copy) costs one point]
* Score 0 for running the tests, where these are provided
* Score 0 for selecting text, formatting the source or for navigating around the code
* Score +20 for touching the mouse or trackpad
* Score +2 if a move causes either the code to stop compiling or tests to fail
* Score double points on every subsequent move until the code compiles and is GREEN again

Challenges adapted from https://github.com/rchatley/RefactoringGolf and
others.
